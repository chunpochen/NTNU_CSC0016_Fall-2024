# Linux Kernel System Call Project

This project involves adding a custom system call to the Linux kernel. The system call will print a message with the highest priority, `KERN_EMERG`, into the kernel log. The message must include the user's school identification. After implementing the system call, it will be demonstrated by calling it at the user level through a test program. Upon execution, a user-level command will be run to observe the printed message in the kernel log.

The project report should include the following:
- Hardware and software environment (if different from previous assignments).
- Detailed implementation steps, including affected files and code modifications.
- Demonstration of the test program at the user level and kernel log output.
- Comments on any challenges encountered and solutions.
- Full code in an appendix.
